# Cancer Text Classification using CNN & Transformers

**About Dataset**

For Biomedical text document classification, abstract and full papers(whose length less than or equal to 6 pages) available and used. This dataset focused on long research paper whose page size more than 6 pages. Dataset includes cancer documents to be classified into 3 categories like 'Thyroid_Cancer','Colon_Cancer','Lung_Cancer'.
- Total publications=7569. it has 3 class labels in dataset.
- Number of samples in each categories:
- colon cancer=2579, lung cancer=2180, thyroid cancer=2810

**Problem Statement:** The goal of this project is to classify the clinical text using CNN, Pre-Trained Models & Vision Transformers and compare the results.

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.

Vision Transformer (ViT) emerged as a competitive alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are currently state-of-the-art in computer vision and widely used for different image recognition tasks.
